        "\n",
        "ans.Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python lets you structure your code by grouping related properties and behaviors into individual objects\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS-A Class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.Any entity that has attributes and behaviors is an object defined under template class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-ENCAPSULATION-Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class\n",
        "ABSTRACTION-Abstraction, on the other hand, is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-Dunder methods, short for \"double underscore\" methods, are special Python methods that begin and end with double underscores (__).\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-A proggramming mechanism that allows objects to be processed differently based on their data type or class.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-There are 2 types of encapsulation i.e.- Protected & Private\n",
        "and they are acheieved by putting single underscore(_) for protected and double underscore(__) for private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an instance (object) of a class is created. The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the attributes of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.- Class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class\n",
        "Static Method\n",
        "A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method can’t access or modify the class state\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-Method overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming where multiple methods with the same name can exist but with different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.- Overriding is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-The @property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that allows you to define methods in a class that act as getters, setters, and deleters for attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-It enhances code reusability, reduces code redundancy,methods of the same name perform differently in given scenarios based on the data provided,having the same function names improves code readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-An abstract class in Python serves as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to define methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-modules that communicate with one another,using inheritance, we can eliminate redundant code,It is possible that multiple instances of objects co-exist without any interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-Instance Variable is basically a class variable without a static modifier and is usually shared by all class instances.\n",
        "Class Variable is a variable that defines a specific attribute or property for a class.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-When one parent class is inherited into a child class and that child class to aonther child class, its termed multilevel inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-The repr() function, on the other hand, returns a string representation of the object that is meant to be unambiguous and complete.\n",
        "str()-Returns a human-readable string representation of the object\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-The super() function is used to give access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-The __del__ method is used to define the actions that should be performed before an object is destroyed\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.-\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.polymorphism allows methods in different classes to share the same name but perform distinct tasks. This is achieved through inheritance and interface design.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS.Methods chaining is a style of programming in which invoking multiple method calls occurs sequentially. It removes the pain of assigning variables at each intermediate step as\n",
